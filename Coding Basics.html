    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p>Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented.</p>  
    <div></div>    
    <p>To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><li>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: &lt;h1&gt;.</li></p>
    <p><li>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
        An example of an attribute is:
        &lt;img src="mydog.gif" alt="A photo of my dog."&gt;.
        In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.</li></p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
    This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
    <li>&lt;HTML&gt; </li>
    This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
    Underneath the HTML we will open two further elements:
    &lt;Head&gt;
    and
    &lt;Body&gt;</li>
        <div></div>
<h3>Rules to remember</h3>
<li>The vast majority of tags must be opened &lt;Tag&gt; and closed &lt;/Tag&gt; with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
</li>
