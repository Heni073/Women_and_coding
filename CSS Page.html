    <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
    <p>CSS syntax includes selectors, properties, values, declarations, declaration blocks, rulesets, at-rules, and statements.</p>
    <li>A selector is a code snippet used to identify the web page element or elements that are to be affected by the styles.</li>
    <li>A property is the aspect of the element that is to be affected. For example, color, padding, margin, and background are some of the most commonly used CSS properties.</li>
    <li>A value is used to define a property. For example, the property color might be given the value of red like this: color: red;.</li>
    <li>The combination of a property and a value is called a declaration.</li>
    <li>In many cases, multiple declarations are applied to a single selector. A declaration block is the term used to refer to all of the declarations applied to a single selector.</li>
    <li>A single selector and the declaration block that follows it in combination are referred to as a ruleset.</li>
    <li>Both rulesets and at-rules are CSS statements.</li>
