   <h3>What is  Coding?</h3>
    <p>
       Coding is what makes is possible to create applications and websites.
       Applications that are developed using coding include just about every piece
       of software that we might use on a daily basis. For example Facebook,
       Google and all the apps on the phone is
       essentially a piece of code. Every device that we use in our daily lives
       has some coding driving it’s operations.
       Your computer actually does not understand your code. What it does
       understand is binary code consisting of 'Yes' and 'No'(or 1 or 0).
       While your code isn't actually understood, the results of your code are.
     </p>
     <h3> Why should I learn coding? </h3>
     <p>
       Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do.
       These things include making your own websites, becoming a coder or even
       starting a technology business. Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand
       the technology shaping your world.
       Coding can have a huge impact on your personal and professional life.
     </p>
     <h3> Why is it important for women to learn to code? </h3>
     <p>
       Women will be changing the stereotype that males can do technical tasks better
       than females can when in reality, it is not true. We are starting to realise how
       important gende equality is. Learning to code and then building the next wave of technology is one of
       ways you can affect history. You are not only becoming a more empowered, but you are
       empowering every woman who sees what you have achieved.
     </p>
     <h3>What programming language should I start with? </h3>
     <p>
       There is no one "best" language, but if you learn one, its quite easy to learn another.
       That said, some languages are more beginner friendly than others. Also the programming language
       you want to start with might depend on what you want to do, for example if you want
       to make an app, you might want to start with Swift.
       Examples of Programming languages:
       <ul>
         <li> Java </li>
         <li> Python </li>
         <li> C </li>
         <li> c++ </li>
         <li> JavaScript </LI>
         <li> PHP </li>
      </ul>
