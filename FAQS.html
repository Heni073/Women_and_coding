  <h3>What is Coding?</h3>
  <p>
    Coding is what makes is possible to create applications and websites.
    Applications that are developed using coding include just about every piece
    of software that we might use on a daily basis. For example Facebook,
    Google and all the apps on the phone is
    essentially a piece of code. Every device that we use in our daily lives
    has some coding driving it’s operations.
    Your computer actually does not understand your code. What it does
    understand is binary code consisting of 'Yes' and 'No'(or 1 or 0).
    While your code isn't actually understood, the results of your code are.
  </p>

  <h3> Why should I learn coding? </h3>
  <p>
    Learning coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do.
    These things include making your own websites, becoming a coder or even
    starting a technology business. Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand
    the technology shaping your world.

    you want to start with might depend on what you want to do, for example if you want
    to make an app, you might want to start with Swift.
